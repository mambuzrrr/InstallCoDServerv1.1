Download the script and place it in any folder on your VPS (RootServer). Afterwards, you need to grant executable permissions to the .sh file:
`chmod +x Install_CoDServer.sh`

Once you've done that, you can now start the script with `./Install_CoDServer.sh`

That's all there is to it!
You can now edit everything necessary and enjoy your own server!
PS:
Edit the "`startmyserver.sh`" script, you need to specify your `IP` and `PORT`.
